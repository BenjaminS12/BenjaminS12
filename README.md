<p align="justify" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">I’m a Computer Engineering student with a strong focus on Front-End development, Cloud Computing, and DevOps. I enjoy creating modern and functional interfaces with React and Vite, and integrating them with powerful back-end solutions using Django, Firebase, and SQL/NoSQL databases. I have practical experience in real-world projects, including attendance control systems, IoT solutions with Arduino and Firebase, Android apps with real-time databases, and ETL/OLAP pipelines using Microsoft tools (SSIS, SSAS, SSRS). While I have full-stack skills, my main strengths are Front-End development, cloud integration, and continuous learning in DevOps and cybersecurity. I consider myself proactive, self-taught, and always looking to improve through new challenges and efficient solutions.
